# Summary

You can use the game's code freely as long as you give credit - either with the code, in an attribution file, or in your readme.

The game's art assets are more protected. You can't use them commercially or for anything unrelated to the game.

If you do make something with the game's assets or characters, be aware that there may be overlap between what you made and what we intend to make. To prevent this risk from impacting the course of development, you're not allowed to claim ownership of any similar game mechanics or plot points we make. Your OCs are still yours, and if you make something we weren't thinking of, we'll ask permission. We might even invite you to the team.

Some parts of the game may have their own clearly marked licenses. If that's the case, go with that instead of these.

If you want to do anything not permitted under these licenses, reach out. I'm not stingy, so unless you want to sell the game royalty-free, we can probably come to an agreement.

Do note that this summary is intended only to help you get the gist of the license, and isn't legally relevant. The full license text is below. Read through it before you use any game contents.

# Separation of Licenses

Game Code refers to the programming logic of the game, including visual scripts, written code, parameter values, configuration files, and any other content that defines the mechanics, behavior, and/or systems of the game.

Game Assets refers to the expressive elements of the game, including images, 3D models, UI layouts, sounds, animations, characters, names, locations, level designs, and non-code writing. This includes any text in the code that may be displayed to the user during gameplay.

If an element meets the definitions of both Game Code and Game Assets, the license for Game Assets takes precedence. If neither definition applies, no license is granted and all rights are reserved. If an element comes with a clearly marked license other than the licenses listed here (excluding licenses granted by the team upon request,) none of the licenses listed here apply to that element.

Regardless of the specific license applied, all contents of the game are provided as-is, with no warranties or guarantees, and neither the team nor any of its members (including former members) can be held liable for any damages that result from your use of the content.

# Game Code License

This license applies only to the Game Code (as defined above.)

You are free to use the Game Code for any purpose (that includes copying, modifying, and redistributing it,) so long as:
* That code does not include or produce any Game Assets as defined above.
* You provide attribution to the original author(s) or the team, either in the code file or a clearly marked readme or attribution file in your project repository.

# Game Assets License

This license applies only to the Game Assets (as defined above.)

We reserve exclusive rights for commercial use of the Game Assets (i.e., any use that directly or indirectly generates monetary revenue.) Non-commercial use of Game Assets is permitted so long as:
* You do not grant any license for the assets to others. If you wish to share the assets with others, you may refer them to this license.
* The assets are used in a manner directly related to the game (for example, a fork, modification, recreation, spin-off, or work of fan art.)
* You agree not to assert ownership of any game mechanics or narrative elements we develop that resemble elements in your work(s) that contain the Game Assets.
* You credit our team and the author(s) of the assets in question, both in your project repository (if applicable) and any publications of works that contain the Game Assets.
