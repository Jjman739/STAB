# S.T.A.B.: Scavenger's Blade

This is a video game being developed in [Unreal Engine 5.4](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5). In it, you play as a scientist who invented a high tech sword that can absorb technology and integrate with his suit to replicate abilities it absorbed by crafting temporary upgrades. For example, after defeating a robot with lasers, you can pick up its scrap to create a wrist-mounted laser gun.

## Status

Beta 0.2 has just been released, so there are now 2 out of 14 intended levels available. I'm taking a brief pause for reaction time before moving on to the next build.

The team size is two people. I am taking care of the majority of the programming, and JoobyG5 seems to be focusing on art. We've also been discussing plans for the course of the game. Alcatraz_Jones isn't a full team member, but is also working on an art task.

At this time, scope seems reasonable for programming, but I am concerned that the rest is going to lag behind. I plan on finding ways to bring more visibility to the project and hopefully catch the attention of more volunteers, ideally in art and level design.

## Plans

I've planned out the general route of the game's story. It will consist of "missions" containing two levels each, except for the tutorial (which will only have one) and the final mission (which may have three, we'll see.)

After the tutorial is completed, four "branch missions" will open, one for each branch of S.T.A.B. (Structures, Tools, Automation, and Biochem.) These can be completed in any order. Currently, the T-class mission is underway. Once those are done, there will be a sequence of two additional missions to wrap up the story. These missions will tie in story elements from the branch missions and have a fixed order.

Each level will have four optional objectives for bonus points, again one for each branch. Each level should come with 1-3 "new" upgrades (that is, not having appeared in any prior levels that the player must have completed to get there.) At least one of these should be created for that level, while others may be reused from levels in non-prerequisite missions.

Eventually, I plan to add a skill tree (using credits earned from score) and a dynamic difficulty system so that you can complete the branch missions in any order and still have appropriate balancing.

For the time being, I would like to release a build each time a new level is complete. If the team expands, I'll consider including multiple new levels per build.

At the current rate, I am aware that this game will take years to complete. That's fine by me, because this is work I enjoy, and the more progress I make, the cooler the game will become, which will motivate me further and possibly inspire others to join in. This is a personal project with no deadline, but I will re-evaluate scope if circumstances require it.

## How to Help

At this time, I am especially looking for artists and level designers to join the team. No programming experience is required, and I can walk you through getting set up with GitHub and Unreal Engine if you need. Contact me on Discord if you're interested.

In any case, the following are always good ways to help:
* **Play the Game.** The game is meant to be played, so you might as well. Whether you're just gaming for fun or figuring out what the project is about so you can join in, please enjoy. Check out the build in the sidebar.
* **Join the Discord.** I have a server dedicated to this game at https://discord.gg/GG2V4e3E25. Just being there will let me know that the game has eyes on it, and that will help motivate me to keep going.
    * **Chat with me.** I'm on Discord as @sotuanduso and would be happy to discuss where the game's at and how it's going, or ideas for where to take it. If you want to help in a concrete way but don't know how, we can find where you might be useful. I can also show you how to use GitHub if you want to help but aren't familiar with it.
* **Download the source code.** If you have [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5), you can download the source code and see where the game's at. Make sure to use Unreal Engine 5.4.
* **Open an issue.** If you see something wrong with the game, or if you want to suggest new features, open an issue here on GitHub. We'll evaluate it and may work it into the game.
* **Tackle an issue.** If you see an issue you think you can handle, feel free to fork the project and take it. I'd prefer if you let me know first so that I can assign it to you and nobody steps on your toes.
* **Join the team.** If you want to help in the long-term, contact me on Discord and I can give you write access to the repository, so you can make your branches here (instead of forking) and assign issues to yourself. We also have a dev chat to discuss the direction of the game.

## Licensing

For the time being, all rights are reserved. I need to take some time to consider the pros and cons of different licenses. Until then, if you want to do anything with the project, let me know. Unless you want to sell my builds royalty-free, we can probably come to an arrangement. I'm not trying to be stingy.

As per GitHub's terms of service, you do not need my permission to fork the project. I'd like to know before you help so that we don't step on each other's toes, but it's not strictly required.
