# S.T.A.B.: Scavenger's Blade

This is a video game being developed in [Unreal Engine 5.4](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5). In it, you play as a scientist who invented a high tech sword that can absorb technology and integrate with his suit to replicate abilities it absorbed by crafting temporary upgrades. For example, after defeating a robot with lasers, you can pick up its scrap to create a wrist-mounted laser gun.

## Status

Game development is going well, last I checked. We have a two person team, and we've completed the first real level. However, this is only a side project, so development may be slow.

## Plans

I have yet to solidify plans for the exact course of the game's story. I know where I want it to end up, and I have a very loose outline for how it will get there, but for the time being, I'm prioritizing gameplay over writing a chapter list.

The course of levels will likely consist of one tutorial/intro level, followed by the story branching into four missions of 2-3 levels each, followed by a final sequence of 2-4 levels.

I intend for each level to have some optional objectives and no more than 3 new unlockable upgrades.

For the time being, I would like to release a build each time a new level is complete.

At the current rate, I am aware that this game will take many years to complete. That's fine by me, because this is work I enjoy, and the more progress I make, the cooler the game will become, which will motivate me further and possibly inspire others to join in. This is a personal project with no deadline, but I will re-evaluate scope if circumstances require it.

## How to Help

* **Play the Game.** The game is meant to be played, so you might as well. Whether you're just gaming for fun or figuring out what the project is about so you can join in, please enjoy. Check out the build in the sidebar.
* **Join the Discord.** I have a server dedicated to this game at https://discord.gg/GG2V4e3E25. Just being there will let me know that the game has eyes on it, and that will help motivate me to keep going.
    * **Chat with me.** I'm on Discord as @sotuanduso and would be happy to discuss where the game's at and how it's going, or ideas for where to take it. If you want to help in a concrete way but don't know how, we can find where you might be useful. I can also show you how to use GitHub if you want to help but aren't familiar with it.
* **Download the source code.** If you have [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5), you can download the source code and see where the game's at. Make sure to use Unreal Engine 5.4.
* **Open an issue.** If you see something wrong with the game, or if you want to suggest new features, open an issue here on GitHub. We'll evaluate it and may work it into the game.
* **Tackle an issue.** If you see an issue you think you can handle, feel free to fork the project and take it. I'd prefer if you let me know first so that I can assign it to you and nobody steps on your toes.
* **Join the team.** If you want to help in the long-term, contact me on Discord and I can give you write access to the repository, so you can make your branches here instead of forking and assign issues to yourself. We also have a dev chat to discuss the direction of the game.

## Licensing

For the time being, all rights are reserved. I need to take some time to consider the pros and cons of different licenses. Until then, if you want to do anything with the project, let me know. Unless you want to sell my builds royalty-free, we can probably come to an arrangement. I'm not trying to be stingy.

As per GitHub's terms of service, you do not need my permission to fork the project. I'd like to know before you help so that we don't step on each other's toes, but it's not strictly required.
