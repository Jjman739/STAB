# S.T.A.B.: Scavenger's Blade

This is a video game being developed in Unreal Engine 5. In it, you play as a scientist who invented a high tech sword that can absorb technology and integrate with his suit to replicate abilities it absorbed by crafting temporary upgrades. For example, after defeating a robot with lasers, you can pick up its scrap to create a wrist-mounted laser gun.

## Status

So far, I have been developing this game solo, on and off alongside other projects. As such, there is no passable build available yet.

I am currently focusing on finishing a tutorial level. I intend to release a build once that is ready.

## Plans

I have yet to solidify plans for the exact course of the game's story. I know where I want it to end up, and I have a very loose outline for how it will get there, but for the time being, I'm prioritizing gameplay over writing a chapter list.

The course of levels will likely consist of one tutorial/intro level, followed by the story branching into four missions of 2-3 levels each, followed by a final sequence of 2-4 levels.

I intend for each level to have 3 optional objectives and no more than 3 new unlockable upgrades.

For the time being, I would like to release a build each time a new level is complete.

At the current rate, I am aware that this game will take many years to complete. That's fine by me, because this is work I enjoy, and the more progress I make, the cooler the game will become, which will motivate me further and possibly inspire others to join in. This is a personal project with no deadline, but I will re-evaluate scope if circumstances change.

## How to Help

Seeing as there's no "passable" build yet (I have made proof of concept builds and released them on my Discord server, but they're little more than sandboxes to play with the crafting system,) there's not much to do yet. But if you are interested nonetheless, you can:
* **Join the Discord.** I have a server dedicated to this game at https://discord.gg/GG2V4e3E25. Just being there will help motivate me, but you can also check out the aforementioned demo build there until I finish a real build.
    * **Chat with me.** I'm on Discord as @sotuanduso and would be happy to discuss where the game's at and how it's going, or ideas for where to take it. If you want to help in a concrete way but don't know how, we can find where you might be useful.
* **Download the source code.** If you have Unreal Engine 5, you can download the source code and see where the game's at. You can fork the project and offer contributions if you want, or open issues if you see a bug or have a suggestion to make.

## Licensing

For the time being, all rights are reserved. I need to take some time to consider the pros and cons of different licenses. Until then, if you want any rights to the project, let me know. Unless you want to sell my builds royalty-free, we can probably come to an arrangement. I'm not trying to be stingy.
